## Start:
[**Original Repo**](https://github.com/namwook0921/KSEA_App)<br>
I was one of three contributors/developers in the project attached above. Due to the given short constraint, the team could mostly prepare for the front end development. Despite being completely new to React Native, I truly had fun developing this project due to two reasons:
1. Higher Result per Effort: Can observe my work enhancing the product in real time as observed on mobile/emulator display --> Effort seems to be better paid off than working on other fields (e.x. Algorithm, AI)
2. **Impact on Community**: First project with the customer/user based on community scope. The fact that I can make an impact on the community seems to boost my confidence quite a lot. This created an internal motivation in myself to allocate as much of my time as possible to enhance the product UI or resolve errors. 

From now (May 2024: End of Freshman Year) to my military enlistment, I have nothing but all the time in the world. I plan to work on this app, especially working on the back-end side to hopefully make it fully functional for the market. Currently, I aim to build the features dedicated to KSEA at Berkeley. However, if the project progress is fortunately expedited than expectation, then I hope to expand the scope beyond KSEA to all Korean clubs in Berkeley (and all clubs, if possible :)

## 2024/05/12: Review Existing Back-end Features
*Plan*:
Some JavaScript files in `src/screens/` incorporate calling content from the back end. Although I mostly designed the screens, I did not contribute significantly in terms of back-end; therefore, I plan to study how the existing app's back-end system worked.

I have several schedules throughout the day, so I don't aim to do a lot. Hopefully I can learn more about Node.js, a platform I plan to use for the app's back-end in the future
